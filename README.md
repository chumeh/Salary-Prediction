An app that uses linear regression to predict the future salary of workers based on experience
Using the dataset called salary_data, I applied EDA to have accurate data
Using regression algorithm, i trained the model see main.py
Used  sklearn to implement statistical concepts, and linear regression
Combined all the task into an object using pickle see linear_regression_model.pkl
used streamlit to build the end.
